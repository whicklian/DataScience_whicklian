    "# Introduction to Machine Learning (ML)\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence is a **branch of computer science** focused on building systems that can **perform tasks that normally require human intelligence**.  \n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) is a **subset** that allows computers to **learn from data** and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "- ML enables computers to **learn patterns from data**.\n",
    "- Instead of hardcoding rules, ML **generalizes from examples**.\n",
    "- Common use cases:\n",
    "  - Image recognition (e.g., identifying cats in photos)\n",
    "  - Speech recognition (e.g., virtual assistants like Alexa)\n",
    "  - Predicting stock prices\n",
    "  - Recommender systems (e.g., Netflix, Amazon)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning is broadly divided into **three main types**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Supervised Learning\n",
    "- Learns from **labeled data** (input → known output).\n",
    "- Goal: Learn a **mapping from inputs to outputs**.\n",
    "- Examples:\n",
    "  - Predicting house prices\n",
    "  - Email spam detection\n",
    "- Common algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "- Learns from **unlabeled data**.\n",
    "- Goal: **Discover patterns or structure** in data.\n",
    "- Examples:\n",
    "  - Customer segmentation\n",
    "  - Market basket analysis\n",
    "- Common algorithms: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "- Learns by **interacting with an environment** and receiving feedback.\n",
    "- Goal: Learn a **strategy/policy** to maximize reward.\n",
    "- Examples:\n",
    "  - Training robots to walk\n",
    "  - Game models (e.g., AlphaGo)\n",
    "- Algorithms: Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks, Policy Gradient methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Key Concepts in ML\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features and Labels\n",
    "- **Features (X):** Input variables (e.g., height, weight)\n",
    "- **Labels (Y):** Output variables (target predictions)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    "- A **mathematical representation** of a process.\n",
    "- Learns patterns to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training\n",
    "- Process of **fitting a model** on data using algorithms.\n",
    "- Goal: Minimize prediction error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing / Evaluation\n",
    "- Measure how well the model predicts new data.\n",
    "- Metrics:\n",
    "  - Regression: MSE, R²\n",
    "  - Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overfitting and Underfitting\n",
    "- **Overfitting:** Model fits training data too closely → poor on new data.\n",
    "- **Underfitting:** Model fails to learn patterns.\n",
    "- Goal: Balance for **good generalization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 4. Example: Linear Regression (Supervised Learning)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predicts a **continuous value** using a straight line:\n",
    "\n",
